Let me give you a little tip, okay? For traveling, a little traveling tip. Try not to wear shorts. Not all that attractive. Took to look at 5 hours. Are you kidding me? No. I wear these on every flight when I travel, because it's very comfortable. These planes, if you notice, get very hot. Yes. I'm sorry. I didn't see where I had to check, because the person I'm sitting next to whistle and pajamas, but I don't wear pajamas on a plane. I like to sing. I like to whistle. I like to play the bongos on my leg. I like to imitate horses, but I don't do it. Okay. Yeah. Because of somebody sitting next to me. Okay. You're very uptight, dude. Very uptight. I don't think it's uptight. It you've never seen a man's leg? Yeah, they grote tusk. What if they were a woman in a skirt? Would you say that to her? If a woman's in a skirt? If they were Harry. Okay, you ready for a hot tub?
